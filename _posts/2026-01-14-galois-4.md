# Fields

From now on, we consider all known quantities to come from a "Field". A
field is closed under the basic algebraic operations like addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division (of non-zero elements).
However, root operations like square roots, cube roots, etc., are not
supported in a field. We represent our field of known quantities as $K$.
$K$ contains the coefficients of the given polynomial and other rational
numbers. We sometimes also assume it to contain roots of unity.

## Field Extension

Suppose $g(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial with coefficients from $K$.
Let $t$ be a root of $g(x)$. Then, we can introduce a new element $t$ to
the existing field $K$ using an extension. We represent this as $K(t)$.
Since $K \in K(t)$ and $t \in K(t)$, any polynomial in $t$ with
coefficients in $K$ must also be in $K(t)$. We can show that this is
enough to form a new bigger field.

Consider the set of polynomials in some variable with coefficients from
$K$. Two polynomials that have the same remainder on division by $g(x)$
is considered to be equal. Addition, subtraction and multiplication of
two such polynomials would result in another polynomial.

For defining division, we need to first define a way to effectively
invert any $a \in K(t)$ such that $a(x)b(x) = g(x)h(x) + 1$. We can
always find this using Euclid's method of finding GCD of two
polynomials. Since $g(x)$ is irreducible, the GCD of $a, g$ is $1$.
Hence all elements of $K(t)$ can be inverted and we can define division
as multiplication by the inverse.

## Splitting Field

The field extension $K(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n)$ which contains all the
roots of the polynomial of the polynomial is called the Splitting Field.
Solving a polynomial is equivalent to finding the Splitting Field. From
Lagrange's Theorem on Resolvents, we have shown that there is always a
$t$ such that $K(t) = K(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n)$. The resolvent
polynomial $g$ which has coefficients in $K$ and takes $t$ as a root is
easy to find. We start with a polynomial whose roots are $t$ and all its
values under the root permutations. This polynomial has coefficients in
$K$. We factorize this polynomial into irreducible factors. The
irreducible factor that contains $t$ as a root is our resolvent
polynomial $g$.


So far we have found that:

1.  $t$ is a polynomial in the roots:
    $t = \psi(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n)$ and the roots $r_i$ can be
    expressed as a polynomial in $t$: $r_i = \phi_i(t)$. $g(x)$ is the
    polynomial whose roots are $t$ and its variants under all the root
    permutations of $r_i\text{s}$. If $g$ can be factorized, we take the
    irreducible factor containing the root $t$ and call it $g$.
2.  Lagrange's Theorem in resolvents can be stated as: $K(t) = K(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n)$. Solving for the roots of the
    polynomial $f(x)$ is equivalent to solving for the resolvent
    polynomial $g(x)$.
