# Groups and Subgroups

We know from our experience of solving cubic and quartic equations that
the process of solving the polynomial involves extending the field $K$
with appropriate entity $r$ to enable factorizing $g(x)$ into a
polynomial $h(x)$ of a smaller degree, such that $h(x)$ has $t$ as a
root and is irreducible in $K(r)$. We would like to know how the
$\text{Gal}(K(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)/K(r))$ relates to the 
$\text{Gal}(K(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)/K)$.

Here is an example. For the cubic equation, we start with the resolvent
polynomial which is of degree $6 = 3!$ with (say $t=t_1$):

$$t_1 = r_1 + \omega r_2 + \omega^2 r_3$$

$$t_2 = r_3 + \omega r_1 + \omega^2 r_2$$

$$t_3 = r_2 + \omega r_3 + \omega^2 r_1$$

$$t_4 = r_1 + \omega r_3 + \omega^2 r_2$$

$$t_5 = r_2 + \omega r_1 + \omega^2 r_3$$

$$t_6 = r_3 + \omega r_2 + \omega^2 r_1$$

The irreducible resolvent
polynomial is:

$$g(x) = \prod_{i=1}^{6}(x - t_i)$$

After we are able to extend the field with:

$$
\begin{align*}
t_1^3 = (r_1 + \omega r_2 + \omega^2 r_3)^3 &= r_1^3 + r_2^3 + r_3^3 + 6r_1 r_2 r_3 \\&
+3\omega(r_1^2r_2+r_2^2r_3+r_3^2r_1)\\
&+3\omega^2(r_1r_2^2+r_2r_3^2+r_3r_1^2)\\    
t_4^3 = (r_1 + \omega^2 r_2 + \omega r_3)^3 &= r_1^3 + r_2^3 + r_3^3 + 6r_1 r_2 r_3 \\&
+3\omega^2(r_1^2r_2+r_2^2r_3+r_3^2r_1)\\
&+3\omega(r_1r_2^2+r_2r_3^2+r_3r_1^2)
\end{align*}
$$

We are able to factorize $g(x)$ into the two irreducible
factors $h(x) = h_1(x) = (x^3-t_1^3)$ and $h_2(x) = (x^3-t_4^3)$. The
Galois Group corresponding to $g(x)$ is $S_3$, the entire permutation
group of all $3! = 6$ permutations. For the resolvent polynomial $h(x)$
we have the roots:

$$t_1 = r_1 + \omega r_2 + \omega^2 r_3$$

$$t_2 = r_3 + \omega r_1 + \omega^2 r_2$$

$$t_3 = r_2 + \omega r_3 + \omega^2 r_1$$

The Galois Group corresponding
to $h(x)$ contains $3$ permutations: The permutation of $(r_1,r_2,r_3)$
into one of $\{(r_1,r_2,r_3),(r_3,r_1,r_2),(r_2,r_3,r_1)\}$. These
permutations correspond to $t_1 \to t_1$, $t_1 \to t_2$, and
$t_1 \to t_3$. We observe that these same permutations map
$t_4 \to t_4$, $t_4 \to t_6$, and $t_4 \to t_5$.

## Subgroup

When $g(x)$ can be factorized into a smaller irreducible polynomial
$h(x)$, such that $t$ is a root of $h(x)$, we can define a new Galois
Group corresponding to $\text{Gal}(K(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)/K(r))$. This new
Galois Group maps roots of $h(x)$ to itself. These permutations can then
be extended onto the entire field $K(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)$ such that it
leaves $K(r)$ unchanged.

The factors of $g(x)$ are polynomials with coefficients from $K(r)$.
Suppose $h_2(x)$ is one such factor. Let $\sigma$ be a permutation from
the new Galois Group. Then, $\sigma(h_2(x)) = h_2(\sigma(x))$. Thus
$\sigma$ maps roots of each factor of $g$ onto other roots of the same
factor. In this way, it maps all roots of $g(x)$ to other roots of
$g(x)$. This proves that the Galois Group corresponding to $h(x)$ is a
subgroup of the Galois Group corresponding to $g(x)$.

## Cosets and Size of Subgroup

Let us denote:

$$G := \text{Gal}(K(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)/K)$$

$$H := \text{Gal}(K(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)/K(r))$$

$H$ is a subgroup of $G$. For any $\sigma \notin H$, consider the set of permutations
$\sigma H = \{\sigma h$ $|$ $h \in H\}$. Let $\sigma(t) = t'$. $t'$ is a
root of $g(x)$, but not $h(x)$. Let $t'$ be root of $h_2(x)$. $\sigma H$
consists of permutations that map $t \to t' \to t''$. We know that
permutations in $H$ map roots of $h_2(x)$ to another root of $h_2(x)$.
Thus, $t''$ is also a root of $h_2(x)$. $\sigma H$ can then be
interpreted as permutations that map $t$ to some root $t''$ of $h_2(x)$.

If two permutations of $\sigma H$ map $t$ to the same root of $h_2(x)$,
then we have $\sigma h_1 = \sigma h_2$ for some permutations
$h_1, h_2 \in H$. But we can then compose $\sigma^{-1}$ to both of them
to get $h_1 = h_2$ which is not possible. Thus, $\sigma H$ has just as
many permutations as $H$. This also means that $h_2(x)$ has just as many
roots as $h(x)$.

We can repeat this process till we have covered all the permutations in
$G$, and equivalently, all the irreducible factors of $g(x)$. Each of
these factors would have the same degree. The sets $\sigma H$ are called
right-cosets of $H$. They all are of the same size. This shows that size
of $H$ divides the size of $G$. This process of dividing a group into
cosets of its subgroup can be carried for any group. In general, the
size of a subgroup always divides the size of the group.

# Factorization by Field Extension

So far, we have looked at the under the effect of factorization of the
resolvent polynomial. We found that Galois Group $H$ is a subgroup of
$G$. The size of $H$, which is equal to the degree of $h(x)$ divides the
size of $G$, which in turn is equal to the degree of $g(x)$.

In this section, we explore the factorization from the point of view of
the Field Extension. Suppose that we extend the field $K$ with an
element $r$ such that $r^p \in K$. We take $p$ to be a prime number. In
the example of the cubic solution from previous section, we can show
that the extension is using
$r = (r_1+\omega r_2+\omega^2 r_3)^3 - (r_1+\omega^2 r_2+\omega r_3)^3$
and that $r^2 \in K$. Another equivalent choices for $r$ is
$r = (r_1r_2^2 + r_2r_3^2 + r_3r_1^2) - (r_1^2r_2 + r_2^2r_3 + r_3^2r_1)$.

## Polynomial Factorization

Let $U(x)$ be a polynomial with coefficients in $K(r)$. Then, $U$ can
also be expressed as a polynomial with coefficients in $K$:

$$U(x, r) =  a_m(r) x^m +a_{m-1}(r) x^{m-1} +\ldots +a_2(r)x^2 +a_1(r)x +a_0(r)$$

If $V(x, r)$ is a factor of $U(x, r)$, then $U(x, r) = V(x, r)W(x, r)$

$$U(x, r) - V(x,r)W(x,r) =  b_m(r) x^m +b_{m-1}(r) x^{m-1} +\ldots +b_2(r)x^2 +b_1(r)x +b_0(r) = 0$$

$r$ is a root of $b_m(y)$, $b_{m-1}(y)$, $\ldots$, $b_2(y)$, $b_1(y)$,
$b_0(y)$. The irreducible polynomial of $r$ over $K$ is $y^p - r^p = 0$.
Thus, $y^p - r^p$ divides all of these polynomials. This means:

$$U(x, r) = V(x,r)W(x,r)$$

$$U(x, \alpha r) = V(x,\alpha r)W(x,\alpha r)$$

$$U(x, \alpha^2 r) = V(x,\alpha^2 r)W(x,\alpha^2 r)$$ $$\vdots$$

$$U(x, \alpha^{p-2} r) = V(x,\alpha^{p-2} r)W(x,\alpha^{p-2} r)$$

$$U(x, \alpha^{p-1} r) = V(x,\alpha^{p-1} r)W(x,\alpha^{p-1} r)$$

What we have shown is that if $V(x, r)$ divides $U(x, r)$, then
$V(x, \alpha^i r)$ divides $U(x, \alpha^i r)$.

## Factorization of Resolvent Polynomial

If $U(x, r) = g(x)$, and $h(x, r)$ is a factor of $U(x, r) = g(x)$, then
all of $h(x, \alpha^i r)$ are factors of $U(x, \alpha^i r) = g(x)$.
Thus, we can find $p$ different factors of $g$ from a single factor
$h(x, r)$:

$$g(x) = h(x,r)q(x,r)$$

$$g(x) = h(x,\alpha r)q(x,\alpha r)$$

$$g(x) = h(x,\alpha^2 r)q(x,\alpha^2 r)$$ $$\vdots$$

$$g(x) = h(x,\alpha^{p-1} r)q(x,\alpha^{p-1} r)$$

Multiplying these, we would get:

$$g(x)^p = H(x)Q(x)$$

where:

$$H(x) = h(x, r)h(x, \alpha r)h(x, \alpha^2 r) \ldots h(x, \alpha^{p-1} r)$$

This would imply:

$$g(x)^j = H(x) = h(x, r)h(x, \alpha r)h(x, \alpha^2 r) \ldots h(x, \alpha^{p-1} r)$$

There are $p$ irreducible factors on the right which when multiplied
give $g(x)^j$. From the previous section, we know that each of these
factors has a degree that divides the degree of $g(x)$. If deg($h(x)$) =
deg($g(x)$)/$m$, then $m$ factors on the right would be of the same
degree as $g(x)$ and $mj$ factors on the right side makes the total $p$
factors. This implies that $m$ divides $p$ or $m=1$ or $m=p$. Thus
deg($h(x)$) = deg($g(x)$)/$p$ or deg($h(x)$) = deg($g(x)$).

We have $p$ irreducible factors whose product is $g(x)^j$. From the
previous section, we know that degree of $h(x)$ divides degree of
$g(x)$. Let deg $h(x)$ = deg $g(x)/m$. Then, it takes exactly $m$ such
factors to match the degree of $g(x)$. However, the left side has $j$
copies of $g(x)$. It follows that the total number of irreducible
factors on the right must be $mj$. But, we know this to be $p$, which is
prime. Thus $m=1, j=p$ or $m=p,j=1$. This gives either deg $h(x)$ = deg
$g(x)$ implying $h(x) = g(x)$ or deg $h(x)$ = deg $g(x)/p$ implying:
$$g(x) = h(x, r)h(x, \alpha r)h(x, \alpha^2 r) \ldots h(x, \alpha^{p-1} r)$$

## Normal Subgroup

Let $t'$ be a root of $h(x,r)$. We know that $t'$ can be written as a
polynomial in $t$: $t' = \psi(t)$. Since $h(\psi(t),r) = 0$, we know
that $t$ is a root of $h(\psi(x),r)$. Thus $h(x,r)$ is a factor of
$h(\psi(x),r)$.

$h(x,r)$ being a factor of $h(\psi(x),r)$, implies that,
$h(x,\alpha^i r)$ is a factor of $h(\psi(x),\alpha^i r)$. Thus, if $u$
is a root of $h(x,\alpha^i r)$, so is $\psi(u)$.

The mapping $t \to \psi(t)$ can be represented using a permutation in
$H$. The permutation that maps $t \to u$ (say for $\sigma \in G$) also
maps $\psi(t) \to \psi(u)$. Thus, the mapping
$t \to \psi(t) \to \psi(u)$ can be seen as a permutation in $H$ followed
by some appropriate permutation in $G$. Thus, the permutation from $t$
to the roots of each factor can be represented as left-cosets $H\sigma$.

We already know that these same permutations can be presented as
right-cosets $\sigma H$. It is a rare occurence that right-cosets are
also left-cosets:

$$\sigma H = H\sigma$$

This relation holds true for
all $\sigma$. In other words for any $\sigma \in G$:

$$\sigma^{-1} H\sigma =H$$

Whenever, a subgroup follows this property,
we call it a Normal Subgroup.

# Solvability

So far, we have shown that, when we extend the field $K$ with a $r$ such
that $r^p \in K$, and the resolvent polynomial $g(s)$ can be further
factorized:

1.  $g(x)$ can be factored into $p$ factors of the form
    $h(x, \alpha^i r)$

2.  The Galois Group $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Size of $H$ is
    $1/p$ times that of $G$.

The opposite of this statement is also true. Suppose we have a field $K$
and Galois Group $G$, that leaves $K$ fixed. If we know a normal
subgroup of $G$, say $H$ with size $1/p$, then there exists an element
$r$ such that $r^p \in K$, and Galois Group that leaves $K(r)$ fixed is
$N$. Before we prove this statement, we explore the consequences of
having a Normal Subgroup of size $1/p$ times the Group.

## Quotient Group

For any normal subgroup $H$ of $G$, the cosets form a group defined by:

$$(Ha) (Hb) = (Ha) (bH) = H(abH) = H(Hab) = Hab$$

This is represented by
the Quotient Group $G/H$. We observe that the Quotient Group is of size
$p$.

## Cyclic Subgroup

For any group $G$, and $\sigma \in G$, we can form the subgroup:

$$\{e, \sigma, \sigma^2,\ldots,\sigma^{k-1}\}$$

where $k$ is the
smallest number such that $\sigma^k = e$. This subgroup is called the
cyclic subgroup generated by $\sigma$ and has size $k$.

## Quotient Group is Cyclic

Let us consider a cyclic subgroup of the Quotient Group, generated by
some $\sigma \in G/H$. Let the size of the subgroup be $k$. Quotient
Group is of size $p$. So, $k$ divides $p$ implying $k=1$ or $k=p$. $k=1$
is not possible, since the subgroup has atleast two elements $e$ and
$\sigma$. $k=p$ implies that the entire group is the subgroup. This
means that the entire group ends up becoming cyclic, irrespective of the
choice of $\sigma$ (as long as, it is not the identity element).

For our purpose, let us represent the cosets as $H$, $\sigma H$,
$\sigma^2 H$, $\ldots$, $\sigma^{p-1} H$. As a consequence, any
permutation in $G$ can be represented as $\sigma^i h$, where $h \in H$.
We can equivalently define the quotient group $G/H$ as $\{e$, $\sigma$,
$\sigma^2$, $\ldots$, $\sigma^{p-1}\}$.

## Solvability

Here is a sketch of the proof of the converse statement, inspired from
Lagrange Resolvents. Given $H$, we can obtain all the corresponding $t\text{s}$
by composing the permutations in $H$ on $t$. Let these be $t_1$, $t_2$,
$\ldots$, $t_m$ with $mp = n$ where $n$ is the degree of $g$. We can
obtain the polynomial $h(x) = (x-t_1)(x-t_2)\ldots(x-t_m)$. The
coefficients of this polynomial cannot be in $K$, since the irreducible
polynomial containing $t$ is of degree $n = mp$. The coefficients of
this polynomial are candidates in $K(r)$. Let us choose one such
candidate and call it $\theta_1$.

Consider any permutation $\sigma$ from the quotient group $G/H$.
$\sigma$ fixes only elements of $K$, but not $K(r)$. $\sigma(\theta_1)$
cannot be $\theta_1$, since $\theta_1 \notin K$. Let
$\sigma(\theta_1) = \theta_2$, $\sigma^2(\theta_1) = \theta_3$ and so on
till $\sigma^{p-1}(\theta_1) = \theta_p$. Consider:

$$r_1 = \theta_1 + \alpha\theta_2 + \alpha^2\theta_3 + \ldots + \alpha^{p-1}\theta_p$$

$$r_2 = \theta_1 + \alpha^2\theta_2 + \alpha^4\theta_3 + \ldots + \alpha^{2(p-1)}\theta_p$$

$$r_3 = \theta_1 + \alpha^3\theta_2 + \alpha^6\theta_3 + \ldots + \alpha^{3(p-1)}\theta_p$$

$$\vdots$$

$$r_{p-1} = \theta_1 + \alpha^{p-1}\theta_2 + \alpha^{2(p-1)}\theta_3 + \ldots + \alpha^{(p-1)(p-1)}\theta_p$$

Atleast one of these has to be non-zero. If not, we can sum it all up to
get:

$$0 = p\theta_1 - \theta_1 - \theta_2 - \theta_3 \ldots - \theta_p$$

$$p\theta_1  = \theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3 +\ldots + \theta_p$$

We could apply $\sigma$ on both sides to get:
$\theta_1 = \theta_2 = \ldots = \theta_p$, which is not true. Thus,
without loss of generality we can assume that the following is non-zero:

$$r = \theta_1 + \alpha\theta_2 + \alpha^2\theta_3 + \ldots + \alpha^{p-2}\theta_{p-1} + \alpha^{p-1}\theta_p$$

Applying $\sigma$ on both sides:

$$\sigma(r) = \theta_2 + \alpha\theta_3 + \alpha^2\theta_4 + \ldots + \alpha^{p-2}\theta_{p} + \alpha^{p-1}\theta_1 = r/\alpha$$

This gives $\sigma(r^p) = r^p$.

Any permutation in $G$, is of the form $\sigma^i h$ for some $h \in H$.

$$\sigma^i(h(r)) = \sigma^i(r) = r/\alpha^i$$

since $h$ does not affect
$\theta_i\text{s}$. Hence:

$$\sigma^i(h(r^p)) = (r/\alpha^i)^p = r^p$$

$r^p$ is
fixed by all permutations in $G$, implying that $r^p \in K$.

We have shown that the process of solving a polynomial by radicals can
be understood entirely through the structure of its Galois group. Each
time the base field $K$ is extended by adjoining an element $r$ with
$r^p \in K$, the corresponding resolvent polynomial factors in a highly
structured way, and the Galois group shrinks to a normal subgroup of
size $1/p$ of the original Galois Group. Conversely, the existence of a
normal subgroup guarantees the existence of a field extension obtained
by adjoining a $p^{th}$ root. Following this trail of Galois Groups from
that of the original polynomial to a group of only identity element, we
can derive a way to solve the polynomial using basic algebraic
operations and radicals.
