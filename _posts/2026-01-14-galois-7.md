# Part 7: Factorization of the Resolvent Polynomial

We know from our experience of solving cubic and quartic equations that
the process of solving the polynomial involves extending the field $K$
with an appropriate entity $r$ to enable factorizing $g(x)$ into a
polynomial $h(x)$ of a smaller degree, such that $h(x)$ has $t$ as a
root and is irreducible in $K(r)$. Here is an example: For the cubic equation, we start with the resolvent
polynomial which is of degree $6 = 3!$ with (say $t=t_1$):

$$t_1 = r_1 + \omega r_2 + \omega^2 r_3$$

$$t_2 = r_3 + \omega r_1 + \omega^2 r_2$$

$$t_3 = r_2 + \omega r_3 + \omega^2 r_1$$

$$t_4 = r_1 + \omega r_3 + \omega^2 r_2$$

$$t_5 = r_2 + \omega r_1 + \omega^2 r_3$$

$$t_6 = r_3 + \omega r_2 + \omega^2 r_1$$

The irreducible resolvent
polynomial is:

$$g(x) = \prod_{i=1}^{6}(x - t_i)$$

After we are able to extend the field with:

$$
\begin{align*}
t_1^3 = (r_1 + \omega r_2 + \omega^2 r_3)^3 &= r_1^3 + r_2^3 + r_3^3 + 6r_1 r_2 r_3 \\&
+3\omega(r_1^2r_2+r_2^2r_3+r_3^2r_1)\\
&+3\omega^2(r_1r_2^2+r_2r_3^2+r_3r_1^2)\\    
t_4^3 = (r_1 + \omega^2 r_2 + \omega r_3)^3 &= r_1^3 + r_2^3 + r_3^3 + 6r_1 r_2 r_3 \\&
+3\omega^2(r_1^2r_2+r_2^2r_3+r_3^2r_1)\\
&+3\omega(r_1r_2^2+r_2r_3^2+r_3r_1^2)
\end{align*}
$$

We can show that the field extension containing $t_1^3$ and $t_4^3$ can be expressed as $K(r)$, where $r = (r_1+\omega r_2+\omega^2 r_3)^3 - (r_1+\omega^2 r_2+\omega r_3)^3$ and that $r^2 \in K$. 

In the new extended field, we are able to factorize $g(x)$ into the two irreducible
factors $h(x) = h_1(x) = (x^3-t_1^3)$ and $h_2(x) = (x^3-t_4^3)$. The
Galois Group corresponding to $g(x)$ is $S_3$, the entire permutation
group of all $3! = 6$ permutations. For the resolvent polynomial $h(x)$
we have the roots:

$$t_1 = r_1 + \omega r_2 + \omega^2 r_3$$

$$t_2 = r_3 + \omega r_1 + \omega^2 r_2$$

$$t_3 = r_2 + \omega r_3 + \omega^2 r_1$$

The Galois Group corresponding
to $h(x)$ contains $3$ permutations: The permutation of $(r_1,r_2,r_3)$
into one of $\{(r_1,r_2,r_3),(r_3,r_1,r_2),(r_2,r_3,r_1)\}$. These
permutations correspond to $t_1 \to t_1$, $t_1 \to t_2$, and
$t_1 \to t_3$. We observe that these same permutations map
$t_4 \to t_4$, $t_4 \to t_6$, and $t_4 \to t_5$.

## Subgroup

When $g(x)$ can be factorized into a smaller irreducible polynomial
$h(x)$, such that $t$ is a root of $h(x)$, we can define a new Galois
Group corresponding to $\text{Gal}(K(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)/K(r))$. This new
Galois Group maps roots of $h(x)$ to itself. These permutations can then
be extended onto the entire field $K(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)$ such that it
leaves $K(r)$ unchanged. Let us denote:

$$G := \text{Gal}(K(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)/K)$$

$$H := \text{Gal}(K(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)/K(r))$$

We know that $\sigma \in H$ maps the root $t$ of $h(x)$ to another root of $h(x)$. For any root $t'$ of $g(x)$, if $t'$ is not a root of $h(x)$, then $t'$ is a root of another factor of $g(x)$. Let us say that factor is $h_2(x)$. The factors of $g(x)$ are polynomials with coefficients from $K(r)$. When $\sigma$ is interpreted as an automorphism that fixes $K(r)$, we can say:

$$\sigma(h_2(x)) = h_2(\sigma(x))$$


Substituting $t'$ for $x$, we get: $\sigma(h_2(t')) = h_2(\sigma(t'))$. This means $h_2(\sigma(t'))=0$. We have showed that $\sigma(t')$ is also a root of $h_2(x)$.

$\sigma$ maps roots of each factor of $g$ onto other roots of the same
factor. In this way, it maps all roots of $g(x)$ to other roots of
$g(x)$. This proves that $H$ is a subgroup $G$.

## Cosets and Size of Subgroup

$H$ is a subgroup of $G$. For any $\sigma \in G, \sigma \notin H$, consider the set of permutations
$\sigma H = \{\sigma h$ $|$ $h \in H\}$. Let $\sigma(t) = t'$. $t'$ is a
root of $g(x)$, but not $h(x)$. Let $t'$ be root of $h_2(x)$. $\sigma H$
consists of permutations that map $t \to t' \to t''$. We know that
permutations in $H$ map roots of $h_2(x)$ to another root of $h_2(x)$.
Thus, $t''$ is also a root of $h_2(x)$. $\sigma H$ can then be
interpreted as permutations that map $t$ to some root $t''$ of $h_2(x)$.

If two permutations of $\sigma H$ map $t$ to the same root of $h_2(x)$,
then we have $\sigma h_1 = \sigma h_2$ for some permutations
$h_1, h_2 \in H$. But we can then compose $\sigma^{-1}$ to both of them
to get $h_1 = h_2$ which is not possible. Thus, $\sigma H$ has just as
many permutations as $H$. This also means that $h_2(x)$ has just as many
roots as $h(x)$.

We can repeat this process till we have covered all the permutations in
$G$, and equivalently, all the irreducible factors of $g(x)$. Each of
these factors would have the same degree. The sets $\sigma H$ are called
right-cosets of $H$. They all are of the same size. This shows that size
of $H$ divides the size of $G$. This process of dividing a group into
cosets of its subgroup can be carried for any group. In general, the
size of a subgroup always divides the size of the group.


## Polynomial Factorization
Suppose the field $K$ is extended using a $r$ such that $r^{p} \in K$, where $p$ is a prime number. The extended field is $K(r)$.


Let $U(x)$ be a polynomial with coefficients in $K(r)$. Then, $U$ can
also be expressed as a polynomial with coefficients in $K$:

$$U(x, r) =  a_m(r) x^m +a_{m-1}(r) x^{m-1} +\ldots +a_2(r)x^2 +a_1(r)x +a_0(r)$$

If $V(x, r)$ is a factor of $U(x, r)$, then $U(x, r) = V(x, r)W(x, r)$

$$U(x, r) - V(x,r)W(x,r) =  b_m(r) x^m +b_{m-1}(r) x^{m-1} +\ldots +b_2(r)x^2 +b_1(r)x +b_0(r) = 0$$

$r$ is a root of $b_m(y)$, $b_{m-1}(y)$, $\ldots$, $b_2(y)$, $b_1(y)$,
$b_0(y)$. The irreducible polynomial of $r$ over $K$ is $y^p - r^p = 0$.
Thus, $y^p - r^p$ divides all of these polynomials. This means:

$$U(x, r) = V(x,r)W(x,r)$$

$$U(x, \alpha r) = V(x,\alpha r)W(x,\alpha r)$$

$$U(x, \alpha^2 r) = V(x,\alpha^2 r)W(x,\alpha^2 r)$$ $$\vdots$$

$$U(x, \alpha^{p-2} r) = V(x,\alpha^{p-2} r)W(x,\alpha^{p-2} r)$$

$$U(x, \alpha^{p-1} r) = V(x,\alpha^{p-1} r)W(x,\alpha^{p-1} r)$$

where $\alpha$ is a primitive $p^{th}$ root of unity. 

What we have shown is that if $V(x, r)$ divides $U(x, r)$, then
$V(x, \alpha^i r)$ divides $U(x, \alpha^i r)$.

## Factorization of Resolvent Polynomial

If $U(x, r) = g(x)$, then $U(x,r)$ is a polynomial with coefficients in $K$. If $h(x, r)$ is a factor of $U(x, r) = g(x)$, then
all of $h(x, \alpha^i r)$ are factors of $U(x, \alpha^i r) = g(x)$.
Thus, we can find $p$ different factors of $g$ from a single factor
$h(x, r)$:

$$g(x) = h(x,r)q(x,r)$$

$$g(x) = h(x,\alpha r)q(x,\alpha r)$$

$$g(x) = h(x,\alpha^2 r)q(x,\alpha^2 r)$$ $$\vdots$$

$$g(x) = h(x,\alpha^{p-1} r)q(x,\alpha^{p-1} r)$$

Multiplying these, we would get:

$$g(x)^p = H(x,r)Q(x,r)$$

where:

$$H(x, r) = h(x, r)h(x, \alpha r)h(x, \alpha^2 r) \ldots h(x, \alpha^{p-1} r)$$

$$Q(x, r) = q(x, r)q(x, \alpha r)q(x, \alpha^2 r) \ldots q(x, \alpha^{p-1} r)$$

The coefficients of $H(x,r)$ and $Q(x, r)$ are symmetric in $(r,\alpha r, \alpha^2 r, \ldots, \alpha^{p-1} r)$. This implies that that coefficients are from $K$. This would imply:

$$g(x)^p = H(x)Q(x)$$

$$g(x)^j = H(x) = h(x, r)h(x, \alpha r)h(x, \alpha^2 r) \ldots h(x, \alpha^{p-1} r)$$

Comparing the degrees, we get:

$$\text{deg}(g) \hspace{2mm} | \hspace{2mm} p \hspace{2mm} \text{deg}(h)$$

But we also know from the previous discussion on cosets that:

$$\text{deg}(h) \hspace{2mm} | \hspace{2mm} \text{deg}(g)$$

For both these constraints to be satisfied, $\text{deg}(g)$ has to be a multiple of  $\text{deg}(h)$. If $\text{deg}(g) = m\text{deg}(h)$, then 
$m\text{deg}(h) \hspace{2mm} | \hspace{2mm} p\text{deg}(h)$, implies that $m = 1$ or $m=p$.

$m=1$ implies, $\text{deg}(g) = \text{deg}(h)$. Or in other words, $g(x) = h(x)$. This is not possible, since we know that the field extension enables us to factorize $g$ into smaller degree factors like $h$.

$m=p$ implies, $\text{deg}(g) = p\text{deg}(h)$

$$g(x)^j = H(x) = h(x, r)h(x, \alpha r)h(x, \alpha^2 r) \ldots h(x, \alpha^{p-1} r)$$

Comparing the degrees again, $j\text{deg}(g) = p\text{deg}(h)$ gives $j=1$. Or in other words

$$g(x) = H(x) = h(x, r)h(x, \alpha r)h(x, \alpha^2 r) \ldots h(x, \alpha^{p-1} r)$$

Thus the factorization of $g$ enabled by the field extension $K(r)$ has a special form where all the factors are related to each other:

$$g(x) = h(x, r)h(x, \alpha r)h(x, \alpha^2 r) \ldots h(x, \alpha^{p-1} r)$$

## Normal Subgroup

Let $t'$ be a root of $h(x,r)$. We know that $t'$ can be written as a
polynomial in $t$ with coefficients in $K$: $t' = \tau(t)$. Since $h(\tau(t),r) = 0$, we know
that $t$ is a root of $h(\tau(x),r)$. Thus $h(x,r)$ is a factor of
$h(\tau(x),r)$.

$h(x,r)$ being a factor of $h(\tau(x),r)$, implies that,
$h(x,\alpha^i r)$ is a factor of $h(\tau(x),\alpha^i r)$. Thus, if $u$
is a root of $h(x,\alpha^i r)$, so is $\tau(u)$.

The mapping $t \to \tau(t)$ can be represented using a permutation in
$H$. The permutation that maps $t \to u$ (say for $\sigma \in G$) also
maps $\tau(t) \to \tau(u)$, since the coefficients of $\tau$ are from $K$. Thus, the mapping
$t \to \tau(t) \to \tau(u)$ can be seen as a permutation in $H$ followed
by some appropriate permutation in $G$. Thus, the permutation from $t$
to the roots of each factor can be represented as left-cosets $H\sigma$.

We already know that these same permutations can be presented as
right-cosets $\sigma H$. It is a rare occurence that right-cosets are
also left-cosets:

$$\sigma H = H\sigma$$

This relation holds true for
all $\sigma$. In other words for any $\sigma \in G$:

$$\sigma^{-1} H\sigma =H$$

Whenever, a subgroup follows this property,
we call it a Normal Subgroup.

## Examples of Normal Subgroup
Normal subgroups are a rare thing. For example in the permutation group of $S_3$, there are subgroups formed by swapping two elements:

$$H = \{(r_1,r_2,r_3),(r_1,r_3,r_2)\}$$

These are not normal subgroups. The only normal subgroup turns out to be the cyclic permutation:

$$H = \{(r_1,r_2,r_3),(r_2,r_3,r_1),(r_3,r_1,r_2)\}$$

What do we know so far:
1. The field $K$ is extended to $K(r)$ using some $r$ such that 
   $r^p \in K$ for some prime $p$.
2. The resolvent polynomial is factorized in $K(r)$. If this is possible, 
   it can be factorized into $p$ factors: $g(x) = h(x, r)h(x, \alpha r)h(x, \alpha^2 r) \ldots h(x, \alpha^{p-1} r)$.
3. If $h(x)$ is the factor containing $t$ as a root, the new galois group 
   correpsonding to $h(x)$ is a normal subgroup of the galois group corresponding to $g(x)$.
